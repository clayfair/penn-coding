# Overview

#In this assignment, I will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives me back data.


#Before I Begin


#LIRI will display mt latest tweets. I do not want to display my personal account, or its keys, so I will make an alias account and add a few tweets to it!
#Make a new GitHub repository called liri-node-app and clone it to my computer.
#To retrieve the data that will power this app, I'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. I'll find these Node packages crucial for my assignment.

#I'll use Request to grab data from the OMDB API.
